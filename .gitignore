This file tells Git which files it should not track.
Local Terraform directories
.terraform/
.terraform.lock.hcl

Terraform state files
These often contain sensitive information and should not be committed.
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup

Crash log files
crash.log
crash.*.log

Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data,
unless they are explicitly named 'variables.tf' or end in '.pkrvars.hcl'
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json

Ignore override files as they are usually environment-specific
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

Include variables to author master copies with safe values.
The user can override these variables with a ".auto.tfvars" file
that is not committed.
!variables.tf
